Use `bundle exec jekyll serve` for testing. Alternatively (the easier way), one could download the VS Code Extension "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey and employ usage of that by right clicking on ANY html file and selecting "Open with Live Server." Have a great day! Make good choices in life!

VS code tutorial:
Make sure to pull before starting to code, so all changes are synced.
Hit "Command S" (saving) before committing and pushing. One can also auto save. You know it's not saved if there's a white dot next to the file you are accessing on the top.
Drag and drop pictures by converting them into JPEGs in Finder and renaming it. Then drag and drop into the appropriate folder. Make sure to call it appropriately in the college apps/tutors.html. Make sure the "path" (path to getting to that image) is correct. Refer to Elaine's for a good example. 
One can use "right click" and "open with live server" to make sure the website looks good before committing and pushing.
One can use "command slash" to comment or uncomment a block of text. No longer are the days of painstaking arrows!
Make sure to commit and push if you want one's changes to be published.
When closing the app after completing one's daily work, one can close the app after saving and committing/pushing.
