    <h2>Sign Up Policy</h2>
    <p>In order to allow all students to have an equal opportunity to receive assistance, 
        each student may only sign up for two sessions of their choosing per week. To clarify, 
        you may not sign up with a certain tutor for two sessions in one week, and in that 
        same week, sign up with another tutor for more sessions. However, you may split your 
        two sessions between two different tutors. </p>
